# MoltenPixels

Delphi project application template for easy management of OpenGL and OpenGLES capabilities.

This "app template" is not a VCL or Firemonkey app, it manages your own app that creates a native window with an OpenGL viewport.

The main idea of the project is to reduce the complexity of rendering 2D Images and Shapes with High Performance, High FPS and Full Cross Platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android), by implementing OpenGL and OpenGLES primitives on each platform.
