# MoltenPixels
# Simple 2D Graphics Cross Platform Fast Library for Delphi
# Win32 Win64 MacOS iOS Android
# Deploy on all Platforms!

MoltenPixels is a Delphi Project Application template for easy management of OpenGL and OpenGLES capabilities.

This "App template" <b> is not a VCL or Firemonkey app</b>, it manages his own App model that creates a native window with an OpenGL viewport.

>The main idea of the project is to reduce the complexity of rendering 2D Images and Shapes with High Performance, High FPS and Full Cross Platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Android), by implementing OpenGL and OpenGLES primitives on each platform.
